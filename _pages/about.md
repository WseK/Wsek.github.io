About me
=====

Hi, this is Ningning Wang and it's my personal website. I am a Ph.D student in Florida International University at present. 

Other things
======
Like any ordinary young person, I have a few hobbies, including fishing, hiking, listening music, watching movies and cooking. If you want to meet a Chinese of the same taste, my email is free.


To do list
======
I know this website is very basic and the information given is sketchy. I will continue to improve this site and populate it with more information. Here is what I will be adding to this site.
1. Migrate the site to my own domain
2. share more content from my personal life
3. Share my current research
4. Recorded notes for self-study
5. Some interesting, strange stuff
